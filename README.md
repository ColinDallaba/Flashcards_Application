# Final Capstone

This is the first full stack web application that I helped to create.  It was made as part of a team of 5 other students with one of the Tech Elevator instructors serving as our ScrumMaster.  It was made in only 11 days after roughly 3 months of learning.  With that in mind we were still learning a lot during the process of making this and within a few days we would have approached the design very differently if allowed to restart but we were in a definite time crunch.  With all that being said I am still very proud of the work we were able to do and I wouldn't trade my team members or the experience that I gained for anything else.

My contributions were largely in the backend though I helped out whatever teamates needed assistance with anything so I had at least a little contribution to almost all aspects of of the program except for the CSS.
